## About üßê <a name = "about"></a>

A time ago I start studying a little about react and react-native. I found myself in the need to learn to make APIs calls in react. But I did not want to spend my life looking for a service to practice api calls, so I built this small local test server.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To test the project. In the console write the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/TorrezMN/fake_server.git

cd fake_server

cd HTTP_Fake_Server

python fake_server.py

```

you should see:

```
Server startet at: [localhost:8080]
Use <ctrl-c> to stop.

```

Opene your favorite Internet browser and go to: localhost:8080
have fun! üòÑ

(You should see a page with documentation about the server End-Points.)


### Prerequisites

In order to run the project you must have installed:

* Python 3
* <a href='https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/'>Faker</a>

```
pip install Faker
