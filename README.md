## About üßê <a name = "about"></a>

A time ago I start studying a little about react and react-native. I found myself in the need to learn to make APIs calls in react. But I did not want to spend my life looking for a service to practice api calls, so I built this small local test server.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To test the project. In the console write the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/TorrezMN/fake_server.git

cd fake_server

cd HTTP_Fake_Server

python fake_server.py

```

you should see:

```
Server startet at: [localhost:8080]
Use <ctrl-c> to stop.

```

Opene your favorite Internet browser and go to: localhost:8080
have fun! üòÑ


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
